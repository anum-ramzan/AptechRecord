# Attendance Managament System 

Attendance Management System (AMS) was one of my first professional ASP.NET MVC projects, and it is very close to my heart because I put a lot of hard work into it. The management told me with their requirements, according to which the application was responsible for managing the studnet attendance and then generating reports through which they can better business decision. Previously, the reporting was done manually on Excel sheets which was time-consuming as data had to entered manually. This application create and export reports in various formats, including PDF and Excel (jQuery Datatables was used).

LINQ was limited with some functionalities at that time so I have to use stored procedure in order to get the desire outcomes. The database first approach was used and then for changes you can make script of sql data. I know it is a bit complexed solution but once you know the hack it is easier for you to do.

I am proud to have worked on it and successfully uploaded it to its domain. I have also kept entire source code (since I have not signed any disclourse agreement). I have shared this project online, hoping it can help others. 

This project remains very special to me.
